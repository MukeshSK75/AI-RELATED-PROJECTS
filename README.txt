This is an repository created to upload my activities related to my interest in Deep Learning 
You should place the index.html and results.html in an templates folder 
the folder should be stored in the same folder as app.py(the code saved as a file)
get your own api key and replace it in myown-api-key in the code (i used groqcloud)
